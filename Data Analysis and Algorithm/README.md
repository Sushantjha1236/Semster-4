## About
Data analysis involves examining and interpreting data to extract meaningful insights and patterns, guiding industry decision-making processes. Algorithms, on the other hand, are systematic procedures designed to solve computational problems efficiently. Businesses and researchers can uncover hidden trends, predict future outcomes, and optimize processes by combining data analysis techniques with well-designed algorithms. This synergy enables the creation of powerful tools and technologies that drive innovation and address complex challenges in finance to healthcare. Ultimately, the integration of data analysis and algorithms facilitates informed decision-making and fosters advancements in various domains.
# [Experiment-1.1](https://github.com/Sushantjha1236/Semster-4/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20and%20Algorithm/DAA_exp-1.cpp)
**Aim:** Implementation of Binary Search using the Divide & Conquer Approach.<br>
**Logic:** Binary search follows the divide and conquer approach in which the list is divided into two halves, and the item is compared with the middle element of the list. If the match is found then, the location of the middle element is returned. Otherwise, we search into either of the halves depending upon the result produced through the match.<br>
# [Experiment-1.2](https://github.com/Sushantjha1236/Semster-4/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20and%20Algorithm/DAA_exp-2.cpp)
**Aim:** Implementation of Quick Sort using Divide & Conquer Approach.<br>
**Logic:** Sort a given set of elements using the Quick Sort method and determine the time required to sort the elements. Repeat the experiment for different values of n, the number of elements in the list to be sorted, and plot a graph of the time taken versus n. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number generator.<br>
