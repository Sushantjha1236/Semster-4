## About
Data analysis involves examining and interpreting data to extract meaningful insights and patterns, guiding industry decision-making processes. Algorithms, on the other hand, are systematic procedures designed to solve computational problems efficiently. Businesses and researchers can uncover hidden trends, predict future outcomes, and optimize processes by combining data analysis techniques with well-designed algorithms. This synergy enables the creation of powerful tools and technologies that drive innovation and address complex challenges in finance to healthcare. Ultimately, the integration of data analysis and algorithms facilitates informed decision-making and fosters advancements in various domains.
## [Experiment-1.1](https://github.com/Sushantjha1236/Semster-4_Practicals/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20and%20Algorithm/DAA_exp-1/README.md)
### Aim:-  
Implementation of Binary Search using the Divide & Conquer Approach.<br>
### Logic:-
Binary search follows the divide and conquer approach in which the list is divided into two halves, and the item is compared with the middle element of the list. If the match is found then, the location of the middle element is returned. Otherwise, we search into either of the halves depending upon the result produced through the match.<br>

## [Experiment-1.2](https://github.com/Sushantjha1236/Semster-4_Practicals/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20and%20Algorithm/DAA_exp-2/README.md)
### Aim:- 
Implementation of Quick Sort using Divide & Conquer Approach.<br>
### Logic:- 
Sort a given set of elements using the Quick Sort method and determine the time required to sort the elements. Repeat the experiment for different values of n, the number of elements in the list to be sorted, and plot a graph of the time taken versus n. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number generator.<br>

# [Experiment-1.3](https://github.com/Sushantjha1236/Semster-4_Practicals/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20and%20Algorithm/DAA_exp-3/README.md)
### Aim:- 
Implement Strassen Matrix Multiplication using Divide & Conquer Approach.<br>
### Logic:-
Matrix multiplication is based on a divide-and-conquer-based approach. Here we divide our matrix into a smaller square matrix, solve that smaller square matrix and merge it into larger results. For larger matrices, this approach will continue until we recurse all the smaller sub-matrices.<br>

# [Experiment-2.1](https://github.com/Sushantjha1236/Semster-4_Practicals/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20and%20Algorithm/DAA_exp-4/README.md)
### Aim:-
Find out the Minimum Cost Spanning Tree using Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm with the help of the Greedy Approach.<br>
### Logic:-
A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

# [Experiment-2.2](https://github.com/Sushantjha1236/Semster-4_Practicals/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20and%20Algorithm/DAA_exp-5/README.md)
### Aim: 
Perform Job Sequencing with a deadline using the Greedy Approach using C/C++.
### Logic:
A greedy algorithm is an approach for solving a problem by selecting the best option available at the moment. It doesn't worry whether the current best result will bring the overall optimal result. The algorithm never reverses the earlier decision even if the choice is wrong. It works in a top-down approach.
