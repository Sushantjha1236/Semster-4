## About
Git is a distributed version control system widely used in software development for managing source code changes efficiently. It provides developers with the ability to track modifications, collaborate on projects, and maintain a complete history of revisions. With Git, developers can create local repositories on their machines, make changes to files, stage those changes, and commit them with meaningful messages. Git enables branching, allowing developers to work on multiple features or fixes concurrently without affecting the main codebase, and merging changes seamlessly once they are ready. Additionally, Git integrates with remote repositories hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, facilitating collaboration among team members and enabling version control in distributed environments. Overall, Git's flexibility, scalability, and robust features make it an essential tool for modern software development workflows.<br>

GitHub is a web-based platform built on top of Git, offering hosting services for version control repositories. It provides developers and teams with a centralized location to store, manage, and collaborate on their codebase. GitHub enhances the Git workflow by offering features such as pull requests, issue tracking, code review tools, and project management functionalities. Developers can easily share their code with others, contribute to open-source projects, and collaborate on projects with distributed teams. GitHub serves as a hub for developers to showcase their work, discover new projects, and foster a vibrant community around software development. It has become an integral part of the software development ecosystem, facilitating collaboration, transparency, and innovation in the global developer community.
# [Experiment-1.1](https://github.com/Sushantjha1236/Semster-4/blob/main/Git%20and%20Git-Hub/gi1.pdf)
### Aim:-
Install Git and create the repository.<br>
### Theory:-
Git is a distributed version control system widely used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects efficiently by managing revisions, branching, and merging. A repository in Git is a data structure that stores all the files and their history for a project. It contains the complete history of changes made to the project over time. Repositories can be either local or remote, with remote repositories typically hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, enabling easy collaboration and sharing of code among team members. With Git, developers can create branches to work on features or fixes independently, merge changes seamlessly, and revert to previous states if needed, providing a robust framework for software development and version control.<br>
# [Experiment-1.2](https://github.com/Sushantjha1236/Semster-4/blob/main/Git%20and%20Git-Hub/git2.pdf)
### Aim:-
Creating branches with GitHub.
### Theory:-
Branches in Git are lightweight pointers to specific commits in the project's history, enabling developers to work on multiple features or fixes simultaneously without affecting the main codebase. Creating a branch allows developers to isolate their changes from the main branch, making it easier to experiment and implement new features or fixes. Common operations on branches include creating new branches using the git branch command, switching between branches with git checkout, and merging changes from one branch to another using git merge. Additionally, developers can rename, delete, or list branches, as well as push branches to remote repositories for collaboration. Branches play a crucial role in Git workflows, facilitating collaboration, code review, and the development of new features in a controlled and organized manner.<br>

### Aim:-
To create and explore Pull requests.
### Theory:-
Pull requests in Git are a mechanism for proposing changes to a repository hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. They enable developers to suggest modifications, additions, or fixes to the codebase without directly altering the main branch. Pull requests typically involve comparing the changes made in a feature branch against a target branch, often the main branch, and providing a summary of the proposed changes. This summary may include descriptions, screenshots, or links relevant to the modifications. Pull requests facilitate collaboration and code review by allowing team members to review, comment, and discuss the proposed changes before merging them into the main branch. They provide transparency, accountability, and a structured workflow for managing code contributions, ensuring that only approved and reviewed changes are integrated into the project.<br>
# [Experiment-2.1](https://github.com/Sushantjha1236/Semster-4/blob/main/Git%20and%20Git-Hub/git4.pdf)
### Aim:-
Editing a file and committing changes on GitHub.
### Theory:-
In Git, a commit is a fundamental operation that records changes to the repository. When a developer makes changes to files in their local repository, they stage those changes using the git add command and then create a commit using git commit. Each commit represents a snapshot of the repository at a particular point in time and includes a commit message describing the changes made. Commits serve several crucial purposes in Git and GitHub workflows. Firstly, they provide a detailed history of changes, allowing developers to track modifications, understand the evolution of the codebase, and revert to previous states if needed. Additionally, commits facilitate collaboration by enabling team members to share and review changes, ensuring that changes are documented and can be easily traced back to their origins. In GitHub, commits are commonly associated with pull requests, where they are reviewed, discussed, and ultimately merged into the main branch, contributing to the project's ongoing development and maintenance.
# [Experiment-2.2](https://github.com/Sushantjha1236/Semster-4/blob/main/Git%20and%20Git-Hub/git5.pdf)
### Aim:-
To Merge Pull Request and Update the local repository on GitHub.
### Theory:-
A merge pull in Git refers to the process of integrating changes from one branch into another, typically merging a feature branch into the main branch (e.g., master or main). It involves combining the commits from the source branch into the target branch while preserving the history and integrity of both branches. This operation is commonly initiated through a pull request in platforms like GitHub, where contributors propose changes, and collaborators review, discuss, and eventually merge the changes into the main branch. The merge pull process ensures that changes are thoroughly reviewed, tested, and integrated into the project's mainline, facilitating collaboration, code sharing, and the continuous development of software projects.
